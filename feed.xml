In that spirit I have created this blog, and I hope in time to generate content that creates some value. Eventually, there will be a comment box following each post. Until then, use email if you wish to comment. I am currently working mostly with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt; programming language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I have managed to set up a blog. The remainder of this post will cover the path taken.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>03-09-2017</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
