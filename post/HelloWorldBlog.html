In that spirit I have created this blog, and I hope in time to generate content that creates some value. Eventually, there will be a comment box following each post. Until then, use email if you wish to comment. I am currently working mostly with the <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> programming language. </p>
<p>This is the first time I have managed to set up a blog. The remainder of this post will cover the path taken.</p>
<hr/><h2 id="starting-point">Starting Point</h2>
<p>I made a prior effort in 2015 using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, the top open source Python static site generator per <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>. Before 2016 I was doing most of my programming in Python, so it was a logical choice. Pelican supports a large number of <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes">Themes</a> and I chose to work with the pelican-bootstrap3 theme. I came close to getting the blog up and running, but never posted it.</p><h2 id="evolution--transcend-and-include">Evolution = transcend and include</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2017. I have been working primarily with Scala since early 2016. Revisiting StaticGen I found only three Scala static site generators listed. I was looking for something "dead simple", so of the two choices presented I decided to try <a href="http://appliedscala.com/s2gen/">s2gen</a>. It worked as advertised, but I decided to try yet another direction after reading and working through <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/ScalaScriptingandthe15MinuteBlogEngine.html">Scala Scripting and the 15 Minute Blog Engine</a>. </p>
<p>The approach presented in the above post used <a href="http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/">Ammonite</a> and <a href="http://lihaoyi.github.io/scalatags/">ScalaTags</a> to create a static site generator that did not involve a template language. I was attracted by the thought of doing everything with Scala. Per the ScalaTags documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"leveraging the functionality of the Scala language to do almost everything, meaning you don't need to learn a second template pseudo-language just to stitch your HTML fragments together"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So borrowing heavily from <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/blog">Haoyi's Programming Blog</a>, I used Ammonite and ScalaTags, combined with the <a href="http://bootswatch.com/yeti/">Bootswatch Yeti</a> theme to create my own dead simple static site generator.</p><h2 id="further">Further</h2>
<p>One thing I like about this approach is the ease of making revisions and additions. Over time, I hope to make some additions to my dead simple blog: comments on posts, links to other scala blogs, links to social media, etc., perhaps even creating another listed static site generator that uses Scala. </p>
